# CMPG-323-Project-4---34486844
Project 4, where automated UI testing meets Robotic Process Automation (RPA). By automating repetitive tasks, enhancing UAT, and ensuring desired outputs, this project revolutionizes testing methods. Utilizing UiPath Automation Cloud and Studio, this initiative shapes automation processes for efficient solution validation.This project aims to streamline User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for a web application using UiPath, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool. UAT is a critical step in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the web application functions as expected before deployment to production. The primary goal of this project is to automate the UAT process, saving time and effort while improving accuracy.
