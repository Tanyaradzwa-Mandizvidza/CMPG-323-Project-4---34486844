# CMPG-323-Project-4---34486844
Project 4, where automated UI testing meets Robotic Process Automation (RPA). By automating repetitive tasks, enhancing UAT, and ensuring desired outputs, this project revolutionizes testing methods. Utilizing UiPath Automation Cloud and Studio, this initiative shapes automation processes for efficient solution validation.This project aims to streamline User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for a web application using UiPath, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool. UAT is a critical step in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the web application functions as expected before deployment to production. The primary goal of this project is to automate the UAT process, saving time and effort while improving accuracy.

# Branching Strategy
I will use a version control strategy for tis project in order to efficiently manage the projects development process. This approach guarantees the main repository's stability while allowing me to work on new features and fixes at the same time.The brances will work as follows.
Master: The stable version of the project will always be found in the master branch. It displays the current level of production readiness. Develop: The branch that will be used for continuous development will be develop branch, it will act as the integration branch. Before being merged into the master branch, it serves as the integration point for new features, bug fixes, and other improvements. 
Feature: Specific features or tasks will have their own feature branches. The develop branch gives rise to multiple feature branches, each of which focuses on a different feature. The feature will be finished and then merged back into the develop branch.
