# CMPG-323-Project-4---34486844
Project 4, where automated UI testing meets Robotic Process Automation (RPA). By automating repetitive tasks, enhancing UAT, and ensuring desired outputs, this project revolutionizes testing methods. Utilizing UiPath Automation Cloud and Studio, this initiative shapes automation processes for efficient solution validation.This project aims to streamline User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for a web application using UiPath, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool. UAT is a critical step in the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the web application functions as expected before deployment to production. The primary goal of this project is to automate the UAT process, saving time and effort while improving accuracy.

# Branching Strategy
I will use a version control strategy for tis project in order to efficiently manage the projects development process. This approach guarantees the main repository's stability while allowing me to work on new features and fixes at the same time.The brances will work as follows.
Master: The stable version of the project will always be found in the master branch. It displays the current level of production readiness. Develop: The branch that will be used for continuous development will be develop branch, it will act as the integration branch. Before being merged into the master branch, it serves as the integration point for new features, bug fixes, and other improvements. 
Feature: Specific features or tasks will have their own feature branches. The develop branch gives rise to multiple feature branches, each of which focuses on a different feature. The feature will be finished and then merged back into the develop branch.

# Features
Read Data from Excel: The automation uses the "Read Range" activity to extract data from a specified Excel file. The range can be customized based on your needs.

Iterate Over Data: It then iterates over each record in the Excel file, performing actions for each record.

Web Application Interaction: The automation navigates to a specific URL where new records can be created.

Data Entry: For each record, the automation inserts data from the Excel file into corresponding fields on the web application.

Error Handling: The automation is equipped with error handling to ensure it can gracefully recover from unexpected issues
